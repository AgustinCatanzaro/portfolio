					<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
					<!-- <span class="image main"><imgsrc="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
					<p>
						I am Agustin Catanzaro. I am from Argentina. I am an
						University student, to learn and grow as a person is my main
						focus. I allways try to have a side project to work on in my
						free time.
					</p>

					<p>
						At this time my knowledge its more wide than deep i know
						multiple languages in a intermediate level. In order in what i
						consider myself more proficient: <br />Javascript >
						Nodejs/express > Mongoose > Java > Python > HTML > CSS.
						<br />I pretend to learn more about the languages that i
						already know, and to learn new things, like REACT, NodeJS,
						.NET, MySQL and MongoDB as a starter point, i dont expect to
						stop learning in any time soon.
					</p>

					<p>
						What i consider to be my most notable traits are my analytic
						and objective way of thinking. Since i like to learn new thing
						all the time i love to work in uncertainty and face new
						challenges. I adapt to change thanks to my flexibility.
					</p>

					<p>
						I relish team work, i have the capacity to comunicate my ideas
						in an effective way. I appreciate the critiscism/feed-back
						that a team partner can bring since it helps to improve. My
						emphaty make me allways open to lend a hand to a team partner
						who need it even if it doesnt apply to my work scope.
					</p>

					<p>
						As a bad trait i would say that when i start with a project i
						full commit to it, and my self critic sometimes make to start
						it over again if i feel like i could make it better.
					</p>

					<p>
						In a more personal fashion i like to learn new thing even if
						are not related to IT. I play Guitar, Bass and Piano. Even if
						im not actually good at any of those instruments, i really
						enjoy the process of picking up a new one and learning how to
						play it in a basic way. I play chess and multiple videogames.
						I like to understand games in a more depth/"meta" way.

					<!-- Exercise Tracker -->
					<h3>Exercise Tracker</h3>
					<p>
						You can create an user, it will give you back an id, with that
						id you can create an Exercise giving it a description duration
						and optionally a date.<br /><br />
						The idea of this code is the use of mongoose to create users
						and then asociate exercise to them so we every user can access
						its own excercise collection.

					<!-- Url Shortener -->
					<h3>Url Shortener</h3>
					<p>
						You can create POST a url with the "https:www.example.com"
						format it gets added to a db and a number referencing it will
						be created. then you can access that POSTed link using the
						generated reference in this link:
						https://url-shortener.agustincatanzar.repl.co/api/shorturl/REFERENCE_NUMBER_HERE<br /><br />
						The idea of this code is to practice MongoDB and Mongoose
						since every interaction depends on it.

					<!-- Jobs API -->
					<h3>Jobs API</h3>
					<p>
						You can create a user which gets Authenticated with JWT. Then,
						wevery user can create its own jobs application to keep a
						track of created jobs offer and set them as
						ongoing/accepted/rejected.<br /><br />
						The idea of this code is to utilize a secure authentication
						method and use it to access to the db with register users via
						hashed passwords and manipulate jobs collection associated to
						every individual user.
						<br />
						<h4> Disclaimer </h4>
						<p>The project is not hosted so is not possible to use the swagger to test it. but im showing the structure there.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Mini Web Project</h3>
					<!-- WORLD COUNTRIES DATA -->
					<span class="image main"
						><img src="images/worldcd.png" alt=""
					/></span>
					<p>
						This project calculates the total world population and amount
						of languages, and compare every country to it to determinate
						which one have a higher amount of population/spoken languages
						in a percentage way. <br /><br />
						The idea of this code is the use of JS DOM and Promises. Since
						it creates most element using js and to get the countries data
						it connects to an API which contains all the information.

					<!-- PLANET WEIGHT CALCULATOR -->
					<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/planetwc.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								In this project we receive a mass of an object, and we use it to calculte the weight of it in different planets. <br><br>
								The point of this code is how we use the planet "string variable" as a direct index to access the data that is stored in an Objet of Object where we get the planet gravity (and image) which we use to calculate the weight.

						to get an optimal way to travel from point A to B
